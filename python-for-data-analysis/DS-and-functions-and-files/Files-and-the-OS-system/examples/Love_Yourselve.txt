For all the times that you rain my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart 
Oh girl for goodness sake
You think I am crying oh my oh weel
I ain't
And I didn't wanna write a song 
Cause I did'nt want anyone thinking
I still care, I don't 
But You still hit my phone up
And baby I will be moving on
I think you should be doing the same thing
I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mamma don't like you
She likes everyone!
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
I was so caught up in my job
Didn't see what's going on
But now I know
