# A first Application: Classifying Iris Species

We will build a simple machine learning application and create our first model.

## Problem

Let’s assume that a hobby botanist is interested in distinguishing the species of some
iris flowers that she has found. She has collected some measurements associated with
each iris: the length and width of the petals and the length and width of the sepals, all
measured in centimeters(cm).
She also has the measurements of some irises that have been previously identified by
an expert botanist as belonging to the species **setosa**, **versicolor**, or **virginica**.
For these measurements, she can be certain of which species each iris belongs to. Let’s assume
that these are the only species our hobby botanist will encounter in the wild.
Our goal is to build a machine learning model that can learn from the measurements
of these irises whose species is known, so that we can predict the species for a new
iris.
